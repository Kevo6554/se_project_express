# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. It consist of different files that serve as an API to connect the front-end of the project. Only the developer sees this side of a site. The front-end makes a request to the back-end which in return processes it and shoots whatever data is in there.The models contain the log-in information, clothing, and weather. It also validates the information. The controllers are your API request. This is the information that is being stored in the database. It GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,and PATCH. Also gives you errors if something is wrong with the website.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
